# Pipeline to Assemble the DNA from a Bacteria sequence by PacBio.

This is the Pipeline used to assemble the DNA of _Bacillus_ sp. RZ2MS9 that was sequence by PacBio. Note that this **is not** an universal pipeline to assembly Bacterial DNA, rather this is a suggestion.

When I was assembling _Bacillus_ sp. RZ2MS9 genome, I found if hard to find detailed information about strategies to assembly Bacterial Genome, so that is why I am making this pipeline available.

**IMPORTANT:** If you find this pipeline usefull for your work, please cite this article: [Bonatelli et al. 2020](https://mra.asm.org/content/9/31/e00623-20.abstract).
